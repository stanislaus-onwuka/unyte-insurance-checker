## About The App
The objective is to create a user interface that allows users enter a keyword into a search bar and see a list of products and see if they are covered by Unyte or not.

1. View search result(s)

2. Compare one product against another and see key differences

3. View the details of a single product


## Technologies
I used `react`, `javascript`, `tailwind` and a bunch of packages 

## Setup

- run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

## Setup using Docker
- Clone the repository
- Run `docker build -t unyte-assignment` to build the image
- Run `docker run -p 8080:3000 unyte-assignment` to run the server locally
